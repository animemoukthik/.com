<p id="d">In the early 17th century, Japan adopted strict isolation policies and severed almost all ties with foreign 
countries. In 1853, the US fleet commanded by Admiral Perry forced the doors open, leading to a modernization of the nation's
 sociopolitical systems and the eventual fall of the Shogunate. The samurai regime ended its life with the imperial 
restoration in 1868. That's what history tells, but in Gintama, that's not what happens. Instead of the US fleet, the 
country is stormed by spaceships coming from four corners of the universe and soon we see it occupied by extraterrestrials.
